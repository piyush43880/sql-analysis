1- Run below table script to create icc_world_cup table:

create table icc_world_cup
(
Team_1 Varchar(20),
Team_2 Varchar(20),
Winner Varchar(20)
);
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('India','SL','India');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('SL','Aus','Aus');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('SA','Eng','Eng');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('Eng','NZ','NZ');
INSERT INTO icc_world_cup values('Aus','India','India');

 write a query to produce below output from icc_world_cup table.
team_name, no_of_matches_played , no_of_wins , no_of_losses




answer-
with matches as ( select team_1  as team_name ,
  case when  team_1= winner then 1 else 0  end as no_of_wins
   from icc_world_cup
   union all
    select team_2 as team_name ,
  case when  team_2= winner then 1 else 0  end as no_of_wins
   from icc_world_cup)
   select team_name , count(*) as no_of_matches_played, sum(no_of_wins) as wins  
   , count(*)-sum(no_of_wins) as losses from  matches
   group by team_name ;
   


2- Run below script to create drivers table:

create table drivers(id varchar(10), start_time time, end_time time, start_loc varchar(10), end_loc varchar(10));
insert into drivers values('dri_1', '09:00', '09:30', 'a','b'),('dri_1', '09:30', '10:30', 'b','c'),('dri_1','11:00','11:30', 'd','e');
insert into drivers values('dri_1', '12:00', '12:30', 'f','g'),('dri_1', '13:30', '14:30', 'c','h');
insert into drivers values('dri_2', '12:15', '12:30', 'f','g'),('dri_2', '13:30', '14:30', 'c','h');

write a query to print below output using drivers table. Profit rides are the no of rides where end location of a ride is same as start location of immediate next ride for a driver
id, total_rides , profit_rides
dri_1,5,1
dri_2,2,0


answer- select d.id , count(d.id) as total_rides, count(e.id) as total_profit
 from drivers as d 
 left join
 drivers as e
 on d.id=e.id and 
 e.end_time=d.start_time
 and e.end_loc =d.start_loc
 group by d.id;


3-write a query to print below output from orders data. example output
hierarchy type,hierarchy name ,total_sales_in_west_region,total_sales_in_east_region
category , Technology, ,
category, Furniture, ,
category, Office Supplies, ,
sub_category, Art , ,
sub_category, Furnishings, ,
--and so on all the category ,subcategory and ship_mode hierarchies 



answer- 
select  'category' as  hierarchy_type, category as hierarchy_name,
  sum( case when region="west" then sales end ) as  total_sales_west ,
  sum(case when region= "east" then sales end) as total_sales_east
   from orders
   group by category
    union all
    select  'sub_category' as  hierarchy_type, sub_category as hierarchy_name,
  sum( case when region="west" then sales end ) as  total_sales_west ,
  sum(case when region= "east" then sales end) as total_sales_east
   from orders
    where sub_category in("paper", "art")
   group by sub_category
    union all
select  'ship_mode' as  hierarchy_type, ship_mode as hierarchy_name,
  sum( case when region="west" then sales end ) as  total_sales_west ,
  sum(case when region= "east" then sales end) as total_sales_east
   from orders
   group by ship_mode;
